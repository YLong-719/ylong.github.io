<h1>Ice Curling</h1>


<section>

  <p>I got to know about ice curling in 2010 when China's Women team won a bronze medal in the Vancouver Winter Olympics. I started watching curling occationally on TV
  after that and it took me 10 years to finally find a chance to try out this sport in real. I started curling with the MIT Curling Club in winter 2021 and became quite good
  at it rather quickly. After a few months of training, I was very honored to be selected to represent MIT in the 2022 College National Championship held in Fargo, North Dakota.
